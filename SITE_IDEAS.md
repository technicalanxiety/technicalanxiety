# Site Ideas & Future Enhancements

## Content Flow Visualization (Homepage Sidebar)

**Status:** Idea - Article First

**Concept:**
Add a simple vertical flow visualization to the left sidebar of the homepage showing the content creation pipeline.

**Visual Structure:**
```
Incubation (Private)
    ↓
Pull (3 active)
    ↓
Backlog (5 scheduled)
    ↓
Published (67 articles)
```

**Implementation Details:**
- Vertical flow on left sidebar (currently blank space)
- Subtle animation on arrows (gentle pulse/fade)
- Manual count updates (not automated)
- Click "Backlog" expands inline to show upcoming titles
- Click "Published" links to archive
- Pull and Incubation are informational only

**Why This Works:**
- Ambient presence, not a destination page
- Shows system exists without demanding attention
- No separate page to optimize
- Fits naturally into existing layout
- Demonstrates transparency without exposing raw incubation

**Critical Constraints:**
- Incubation content stays private (no titles shown)
- Pull shows count only, not titles
- Manual updates prevent metric optimization
- If checking sidebar multiple times per session = performing for yourself
- Must remain boring enough to forget it's there

**Prerequisites:**
1. Write article explaining the incubation system
2. Publish article first
3. Then implement visualization as proof system is real

**Article Topics to Cover:**
- The parking lot system
- Why incubation must be private
- How forcing functions work (72hr rule, Pull limit of 3)
- Why most ideas should die
- The difference between work artifacts (answers) and personal writing (questions)
- How this prevents feeding the publishing machine reflexively

**Anti-Pattern to Avoid:**
Do not build the visualization first. That's optimization before validation. The article proves the system works. The visualization shows it's real.

## Notes from Discussion

**What doesn't work:**
- Full "how the sausage is made" page - turns incubation into performance
- Showing Cold/Warming titles publicly - defeats the forcing functions
- Automatic updates - creates engagement metrics instead of constraints

**The test:**
Would this feature make you more or less likely to:
- Kill Cold ideas freely?
- Let the Pull limit actually constrain you?
- Publish slower?

If "less likely" to any = you're building accountability theater.

**Remember:**
The incubation system only works if it's boring and invisible. Making it interesting kills it.
