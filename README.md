## 📝 Content Management

### Automated Publishing Workflow

The site uses an automated publishing system with scheduled posts:

**Directories**:
- `src/content/posts/` - Published posts (live on site)
- `src/content/backlog/` - Scheduled posts (future dates)

**Publishing Commands**:
```bash
# List all scheduled posts
npm run backlog:list

# Check which posts are ready to publish
npm run backlog:check

# Create a new scheduled post
npm run backlog add "Post Title"

# Manually publish a specific post
npm run backlog publish post-filename.md
```

### Adding New Blog Posts

**Option 1: Scheduled Publishing (Recommended)**
```bash
# Create a new scheduled post
npm run backlog add "Your Post Title"

# Edit the generated file in src/content/backlog/
# Set a future date in frontmatter
# The post will auto-publish when the date arrives
```

**Option 2: Direct Publishing**
1. Create a new `.md` file in `src/content/posts/`
2. Use the frontmatter template below
3. Commit and push to deploy immediately

### Frontmatter Template

```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title"
date: 2026-01-01
tags: [Azure, Leadership, Anxiety]
description: "Brief description for SEO (150-160 characters)"
image: "your-image.jpg"           # Optional - filename only, stored in public/img/
series: "Optional Series Name"    # Optional
series_order: 1                   # Optional - for backlog posts
series_part: 1                    # Optional - for published posts
---
```

### Automated Publishing

- **Schedule**: Daily at 9 AM UTC
- **Process**: Posts with dates ≤ today automatically move from backlog to published
- **Deployment**: Publishing triggers automatic site rebuild and deployment
- **Series Links**: Automatically updates navigation between series parts

### Content Guidelines

- **Images**: Place originals in `public/img/`, run `node optimize-images.js` to generate optimized versions
- **Tags**: Use PascalCase format: `[Azure, Leadership, Anxiety]`
- **Internal Links**: Always use trailing slashes: `/post-slug/`
- **Series**: Use consistent series names across all parts

### Series Management

**Series Landing Pages**: Each series has a dedicated landing page at `/series/[series-slug]/` that provides:
- Series overview and description
- Complete list of all parts in order
- Tags and metadata
- Only appears when series has published posts

**Creating a New Series**:
1. Create series metadata file in `src/content/series/series-name.md`
2. Add frontmatter with title, description, image, tags, order, and featured status
3. Write series overview content in markdown
4. Ensure series name in posts matches series title exactly

**Series URLs**:
- Series index: `/series/`
- Individual series: `/series/confidence-engineering/`
- Series posts automatically link to landing page via SeriesNavigation component

## 🔧 Development

### Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:4321 in your browser
```

### Testing

The site includes comprehensive testing:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run tests in watch mode (for development)
npm run test:watch

# Run specific test file
npm run test src/test/content-migration.test.ts
```

### Build and Deploy

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build locally
npm run preview

# Deploy (automatic via GitHub Actions)
git push origin main
```

## 🚀 Deployment

The site is automatically deployed via GitHub Actions with two workflows:

### Automated Publishing
- **Schedule**: Daily at 9 AM UTC
- **Trigger**: Automatic (cron) or manual via GitHub Actions
- **Process**: Moves scheduled posts to published, updates series links, triggers deployment

### Azure Static Web Apps Deployment

- **Build**: Astro static site generation
- **Deploy**: Azure Static Web Apps with global CDN

### Deployment Targets

- **Production**: [www.technicalanxiety.com](https://www.technicalanxiety.com) (master branch)
- **Preview**: Automatic preview deployments for pull requests

### Manual Deployment

```bash
# Build and deploy (automatic via GitHub Actions)
git push origin master

# Or manually trigger auto-publish workflow
# Go to GitHub Actions → "Publish Scheduled Posts" → "Run workflow"
```

## 🎨 Customization

### Theme and Styling

- **CSS Variables**: Defined in `src/styles/theme.css`
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Automatic system detection with manual toggle
- **Typography**: Configured in `src/styles/base.css`

## 📊 Analytics and SEO

### Analytics Setup

- **Google Analytics**: Configured in `src/config.ts`
- **Search Console**: Sitemap automatically generated at `/sitemap.xml`

### SEO Features

- Automatic meta tags and Open Graph data
- Structured data for blog posts
- RSS feed at `/rss.xml`
- Optimized images with lazy loading

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build Errors**
```bash
# Clear cache and rebuild
rm -rf node_modules/.astro
npm run build
```

**Content Not Showing**
- Check frontmatter syntax in blog posts
- Verify file is in correct directory (`src/content/posts/` for published, `src/content/backlog/` for scheduled)
- Ensure date format is correct (YYYY-MM-DD)
- For scheduled posts, check if date is in the future

**Images Not Loading**
- Verify images are in `public/img/`
- Use filename only in frontmatter (no path, no quotes): `image: filename.jpg`
- Run `node optimize-images.js` after adding new images
- Ensure image files are committed to git

**Auto-publish Not Working**
- Check GitHub Actions logs for "Publish Scheduled Posts" workflow
- Verify posts in backlog have dates ≤ today
- Check that PAT_TOKEN secret is configured in repository settings
