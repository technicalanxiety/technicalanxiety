# Publishing Gate & Incubation Discipline

## You Are Editing Content That Feeds The Machine

This file appears when you're working on:
- **Backlog posts** - articles queued for publishing
- **INCUBATION.md** - your idea parking lot

Both are critical forcing functions. Don't bypass them.

## Pre-Publish Checklist (Backlog Posts)

Before committing a backlog post, answer these honestly:

### Time Gates
- [ ] Has this idea survived at least 72 hours in Cold?
- [ ] Did it earn Warming by passing the memory test (restate without re-reading)?
- [ ] Has it been in Pull long enough to prove it's worth finishing?

### Quality Gates
- [ ] Can you state the core claim in one sentence?
- [ ] Does this solve a real problem or just feed momentum?
- [ ] Would you still publish this if nobody read it?
- [ ] Is this a question (personal writing) or an answer (work artifact)?

### Machine Check
- [ ] Are you publishing because it's ready, or because the calendar says so?
- [ ] Did you check Pull count before adding this? (Max 3 items)
- [ ] Is this article earning its place or just filling a slot?

**If you answered "no" or hesitated on any of these, stop. Let it sit longer.**

## Incubation Discipline (INCUBATION.md)

When editing your incubation file, remember:

### Entry Rules
- **One claim, one tension, one question** - if it takes more than 4 lines, it's not ready
- **Never park full articles** - full drafts create obligation, obligation defeats incubation
- **Date captured** - timestamp everything, time is your filter
- **Status only: Cold, Warming, Pull** - no tags, no categories, no optimization

### Movement Rules
- **Cold → Warming**: Only if you still care AND can restate without re-reading
- **Warming → Pull**: Only if worth spending energy on AND Pull has room (max 3)
- **Pull → Backlog**: Only when finished, not when impatient

### Death Is The Feature
- Most ideas should die in Cold (72+ hours kills weak ideas)
- If you're "cleaning up" the incubation file, you're optimizing for output
- Messy Cold ideas are healthy - tidy ones are performative

### The Test
After two weeks, you should notice:
- Fewer drafts
- Stronger opinions  
- Less urge to publish immediately
- More confidence killing ideas

**If that's not happening, you're still feeding the machine.**

## Red Flags

Stop immediately if you notice:

### Publishing Red Flags
- Publishing on a schedule instead of when ready
- Feeling obligated because you announced it
- Rushing to "get it out there"
- Checking metrics before writing
- Comparing output to last month

### Incubation Red Flags  
- Moving ideas to Warming before 72 hours
- Re-reading notes to remember what you meant
- More than 3 items in Pull
- Organizing/categorizing Cold ideas
- Feeling pressure to "convert" ideas

### Machine Feeding Behaviors
- Checking the Content Pipeline visualization multiple times per day
- Updating counts to show progress
- Feeling good about a full Pull column
- Treating Backlog like a queue instead of a filter
- Publishing to maintain momentum

## The Reminder You Need

**The tools didn't break you. The tools revealed how badly you had broken yourself.**

The incubation system and publishing gates exist because:
- Your hunger is infinite
- Your capacity is not
- AI tools removed the speed limit
- Your body still has one

**Patience isn't a virtue you can summon. It's a constraint you have to build.**

These gates are the constraint. Don't bypass them.

## When To Ignore This File

Never.

If you're thinking "this doesn't apply right now" or "I'll just skip the checklist this once," that's exactly when you need it most.

The machine is patient. It will wait for you to feed it.

Don't.
