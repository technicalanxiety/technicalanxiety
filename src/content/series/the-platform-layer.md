### Overview

Platform architecture is the most misunderstood role in technology. It's not enterprise architecture, cloud architecture, infrastructure architecture, or security architecture. It's the integration across all of them. The discipline that ensures decisions in one domain align with the others. The foundation everything else builds on.

This series defines what platform architecture actually is, why it matters more than most organizations realize, and how to operationalize it.

### The Core Problem

Many organizations have platform architects without knowing it. Someone is doing the integration work under a different title. The problem is when nobody is doing it. When each domain operates independently. When cloud decisions happen without infrastructure input. When security requirements emerge after architecture is set.

In those organizations, the platform erodes through accumulated misalignment. Each team optimizes for their domain while the overall foundation weakens.

### What You'll Learn

**Part 1: What It Is**
Platform architecture defined: vision and enablement for the integrated foundation. The translation function between business objectives and technical implementation. Why this discipline exists at the intersection of every other architecture domain.

**Part 2: Why It Matters**
What happens when the platform layer is strong versus neglected. How platform decisions compound over time. Why weak platforms eventually constrain everything built on top of them.

**Part 3: How Do You Do It**
Operationalizing platform architecture in your organization. Building the function, establishing authority, creating the feedback loops that turn platform decisions into organizational capability.

### Why This Matters

Enterprise architecture asks "what should we build?" Cloud architecture asks "where should we build it?" Infrastructure architecture asks "what do we build it on?" Security architecture asks "how do we protect it?"

Platform architecture asks "how does it all hold together?"

That integration question is where organizations succeed or fail at scale.

### Who This Is For

Architects trying to understand where their role fits in the broader landscape. Leaders building platform teams. Practitioners who sense that something is missing in how their organization makes technology decisions. Anyone who's watched domain-specific optimization create organization-wide fragmentation.

### The Throughline

This series defines the layer where [Decide or Drown](/series/decide-or-drown/) decisions get implemented. It's the foundation for [Platform Resiliency](/series/platform-resiliency/) and the home for [Confidence Engineering](/series/confidence-engineering/) capabilities.

*The platform is vision plus enablement. Someone has to see across the silos and ensure the foundation holds together. That's what platform architects do.*
