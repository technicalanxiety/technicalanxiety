## Overview

Resiliency isn't about preventing failures—it's about surviving them gracefully. This series covers building platforms that handle real-world chaos through deliberate design, not wishful thinking.

## What You'll Learn

### Core Principles
- **Failure Modes**: Design how systems fail, don't just hope they won't
- **Graceful Degradation**: Maintain core functionality when dependencies fail
- **Operational Discipline**: The processes that make resiliency real
- **Testing Chaos**: Validate resilience before production proves it

### Practical Implementation
- Circuit breakers and retry patterns that actually work
- Dependency management for distributed systems
- Monitoring and alerting for resilience metrics
- Incident response patterns

## Why This Matters

Platforms fail. Networks partition. Dependencies timeout. The question isn't if these things will happen—it's whether your platform survives when they do.

## Who This Is For

- **Platform Engineers** building reliable infrastructure
- **SREs** responsible for system reliability
- **Architects** designing distributed systems
- **Operations Teams** managing production platforms

*Real resiliency comes from accepting that everything fails and designing accordingly.*
