# Backlog Directory

This directory contains scheduled posts that will be automatically published by GitHub Actions.

## How it works:
1. Place markdown files with future dates in this directory
2. GitHub Actions runs daily at 9 AM UTC
3. Posts with dates <= today are moved to the main posts directory
4. Site rebuilds automatically with new content

## File naming:
Use the same naming convention as regular posts:
- `post-title.md` (no date prefix needed in Astro)
- Date is specified in frontmatter: `date: 2024-12-25`

## Frontmatter format:
```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title"
date: 2024-12-25
tags: [Tag1, Tag2]
description: "SEO description"
image: "image-filename.jpg"
---
```
